# Hackathon-Junction2021
Me and my team are invited to CGI & KONE sky(scraper)-is-the-limit challenge, where we will build unimaginable creative solution to make maintenance services even smarter. This 
Challenge is from serious elevator maintenance service business.



Insights :


Elevators, escalators, and automatic building doors with KONE 24/7 Connected Services are constantly sending data to the cloud where it is analyzed and potential issues are identified. Appropriate action recommendations are then automatically sent to maintenance technicians who will resolve the issues before they happen. The action recommendations are created by a host of algorithms from heuristics to machine learning models. Technician feedback is used to constantly improve these algorithms.Your challenge is to create a solution that evaluates the action recommendations and makes the final decision which ones to send to technicians and which ones to discard based on the technician feedback.



How To Run :


You have to import your training and test data into google colab
